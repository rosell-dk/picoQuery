# picoQuery

### How to use

1. Build your subset here: http://picoquery.com/builder/<br>
2. Simply include that custom script instead of jQuery.

### Please help spreading the word!
Till this date, picoquery.com has been visited only by 24 unique visitors, ten of them being my friends on facebook. Please help me spreading the word about picoQuery, so I can keep focus on coding. Also, I really do not have the knack of making people interested in stuff. But again, if nobody is going to use this framework, that I work on about five hours a day, I'm not going to continue spending so much time developing it. So please help moving this project on. Post on facebook or twitter, mention it to your colleagues. Mention it on coding forums. Or your blog. On stackoverflow. Anything! Right now, it doesn't take a lot of efford to double the number of unique visitors, but even just 24 more visitors will matter to me. Thanks!
