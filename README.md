# picoQuery
picoQuery implements a subset of jQuery. The full version currently supports 55 methods. You can however choose exactly which methods you need in the online builder. The full version is *very light* - only 3kb gzipped. Selecting a subset gets you further down.

picoQuery is written for modern browsers (IE9+), but automatically detects if the browser is unsupported and falls back to jQuery 1.12.4, if so. So actually you get IE6+ compatibility with picoQuery.

### How to use

1. Build your subset here: http://picoquery.com/builder/<br>
2. Simply include that custom script instead of jQuery.
