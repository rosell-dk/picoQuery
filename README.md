# picoQuery
picoQuery is a subset of jQuery. &ndash; A subset *you* get to choose. Its IE9+, but automatically falls back to jQuery<br> (so actually, it is IE6+)</small></p>;

### How to use

1. Build your subset here: http://picoquery.com/builder/<br>
2. Simply include that custom script instead of jQuery.
