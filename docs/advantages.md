# Advantages
- picoQuery is <i>ultra</i>-light. Even if you choose the largest subset currently available (55 methods), its only 3kb zipped
- If you know jQuery, there is nothing new to learn
- If your project grows and turns out to require advanced features, migration to jQuery is as easy as including jQuery instead of picoQuery
- jQuery syntax is very expressive, so not only is picoQuery light, but your code that relies on picoQuery, will probably also be light. Plus you get the job done quickly with "jQuery"
- The fallback to jQuery 1.12.4 ensures that it works in older browsers, such as IE6-8
