- picoQuery is originally based on picoCSS, available here: https://github.com/vladocar/picoCSS
- Here is a resource for writing code without jQuery: http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
- There exists a library called *Zepto.js*, which also implements a subset of jQuery. *Zepto.js* implements almost the full jQuery api. Its also modular, but the feature selector is not as fine grained as picoquery, and its not possible to get below ~10k gzipped (picoQuery is 1k-3k, jQuery 1.12.4 is ~33k). http://zeptojs.com/
