# Roadmap

### Features planned for 0.5 (release date: ~25/11-2016)
- Make .attr(), .find() and .filter() fully compliant
- Support jQuery( html, attributes ) signature
- More API. I expect to work on animation methods, such as slideDown(). Please let me know if there is a particular method you wish to be included. You can enter wishes on [this page](https://github.com/rosell-dk/picoQuery/wiki/Wishlist) on the wiki.
- Improve the builder UI a bit (especially the method selection part)

### Features planned for 0.6:
- Option to granularly downgrade functionality for each method. If you know you never use certain signatures/features of a method, you can deselect the signature/feature in order to get size down. It will also be visible when there are features that picoQuery does not support.
- Possibility to see the code that will be generated for each method, depending on what sub-functionality are selected
- Browser tests. I will apply for a free "open source" account on browsershack.com
- picoQuery.com and the CDN must run on HTTPS


### Features planned for 1.0:
- Support *all* jQuery methods
