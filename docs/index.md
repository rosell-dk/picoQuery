# picoQuery
picoQuery implements a subset of jQuery. The full version currently supports 55 methods. You can however choose exactly which methods you need in the online builder. The full version is *very light* - only 3kb gzipped. Selecting a subset gets you further down.

picoQuery is written for modern browsers (IE9+), but automatically detects if the browser is unsupported and falls back to jQuery 1.12.4 if so. So actually, you get IE6+ compatibility with picoQuery.

### How to use

1. Build your subset in the [online builder](/builder/)<br>
2. Simply include the generated script instead of jQuery.
