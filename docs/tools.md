# Tools
- I have build a small tool that logs the jQuery methods used in an application real-time. Its available [here](http://picoquery.com/lab/feature-detect/). The purpose is of course to find out what methods are required in the picoQuery build. For the tool to be more useful, I plan to have it calculate the picoquery build id (right now it just outputs the methods used). It consist of a script that you include after you include jQuery. The script intercepts all jQuery methods in order to record the usage.
- Future tool: A tool to merge two build ids.
